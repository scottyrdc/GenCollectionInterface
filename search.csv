Because it looked different, it had a very low self-image and did not work hard to learn how to speak. One night, a fire broke out in their village. The short-eared rabbit helped to fight the fire and make the villagers safe. After the fire, the short-eared rabbit realized its strength even though it looked different from all the other rabbits. <br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src=""http://www.archive.org/images/icdllogo.jpg"" alt=""icdllogo.jpg"" /></td> <td>This book will be available shortly on the <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">International Children's Digital Library</a>, a joint project of the Internet Archive and University Of Maryland. </td> </tr></table>","","leerbbt","","A Rabbit With Short Ears"

He escaped from the accident and struggled back to the green grass, which he had lived for few days with a little girl. He felt the care from the human and enjoyed his living on the green grass.<br /><br /> Story 3 (The absconding of the button) A black button was fixed in the new jacket of a little girl, who always took the jacket off forcibly and the black button disliked very much. One day, the jacket was dirty and was placed inside a washing machine for washing. During the washing process, black button fled and enjoyed freedom.

But the prince is bored by empty beauty. The Prince insists on marrying a woman who is smart, and establishes a story-telling contest (where the winner must tell a story which begins and ends with the impossible) to find the cleverest woman in the kingdom. The woman he falls for is not beautiful in traditional standards and wears simple clothing, but enchants the prince with her creativity and wit as she weaves a story with endless surprises. The story teller finds a city atop a palm tree, steps into a market inside a watermelon grown on a magical field, and, after an endless series of surprises, is ultimately shot from a canon for pulling the tail off a donkey (a false conviction by a zany judge), landing in the castle in front of the Prince. An exciting, unique story which grabs readers attention. <br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src=""http://www.archive.org/images/icdllogo.jpg"" alt=""icdllogo.jpg"" /></td> <td>You can also <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org:8080/servlet/BookPreview?bookid=nimstor_00310005&summary=true&route=text"" rel=""nofollow"">read a copy of 'A Story That Begins And Ends With The Imagination'</a> by going to the <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">International Children's Digital Library</a>, a joint project of the Internet Archive and University Of Maryland.</td> </tr></table>","","nimstor","","A Story That Begins And Ends With The Imagination"

They agree that a black cat will lead all the cats half the year, and a light cat the other half of the year, but fights still break out between the two groups. Suddenly a grey cat is born, he is wise, and all the cats like him. They decide to make him the leader all year long. The situation is calm for a while and then fights break out. The grey cat orders all cats to take off their ears and give them to him. When the cats are given back their ears, the black cats are given the blond cats' ears, and visa versa. Suddenly each group hears voices they never heard before, the voices of the other group. At the end of the story, a black kitten says to a white kitten, Did we really need to exchange ears to be able to hear each other? <br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src=""http://www.archive.org/images/icdllogo.jpg"" alt=""icdllogo.jpg"" /></td> <td>You can also <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org:8080/servlet/BookPreview?bookid=catbear_00310003&summary=true&route=text"" rel=""nofollow"">read a copy of 'Blond Ear Black Ear'</a> by going to the <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">International Children's Digital Library</a>, a joint project of the Internet Archive and University Of Maryland.</td> </tr></table>","","catear","","Blond Ear Black Ear"

One day Dokdok wakes up in pain and he finds out that Dada the mouse is biting his feet in her attempt to steal his shoes. She succeeds in stealing the shoes and takes them home to sell so that she can buy shoes for herself. Dokdok calls on the cat for help. The cat cuts the mouse's tail off and in return for the tail the mouse must find many things for all the friends. He soon learns it was all a trick to give back Dokdok's shoes. The mouse finally gets its tail back but doesn't know how to put it back on so the friends send her to the spider to teach it to sew and knit so that she can be useful rather than have to steal from others. <br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src=""http://www.archive.org/images/icdllogo.jpg"" alt=""icdllogo.jpg"" /></td> <td>You can also <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org:8080/servlet/BookPreview?bookid=hgbdada_00110006&summarymary=true&route=text"" rel=""nofollow"">read a copy of 'Dokdok And Dada The Biter'</a> by going to the <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">International Children's Digital Library</a>, a joint project of the Internet Archive and University Of Maryland.</td> </tr></table>","","hgbdada","","Dokdok And Dada The Biter"

Story 2 (Lion drops into the lake): A cruel lion ordered other animals to paint portrait for it. It would hurt the painters if it disliked the portrait. A clever fox figured out a tactful plan and carried the lion to the lake for finding a good drawer. Cruel lion saw his face from lake water and did not believe. It then jumped into the water to fight with its image. Lastly, it drowned in the lake. Story 3 (Story of braver): A boy was an unreliable and lazy guy.

One day, an animal came to the earth and promised to achieve our desire by exchanging our land resource. People believed and were happy to get what they wanted by exchanging the land resource. Time after time, the land resource was used up and left only pollution of the civilization products. People knew the danger and wanted to destroy the animal. They discovered that the animal would be the devil of our heart. How could they do? Story 2 (The flying chicken that I saw): A boy always told lies to his friend. This time he also promised his classmate to carry some strange animals to let his classmates see. Lastly, he really invited the animals by simply calling their name. More and more, he could not stop to call strange animals and he and his friend really scared of those kinds of strange animals. Finally, he cried and woke up from his dream. He realized that he was wrong to tell lies and said sorry to his classmates. Story 3 (Turn off small light bulb): In an unknown place, there were many people living together. They worked with joys and enjoyed all days and nights. One day, a hunter came into the place and gave them a light bulb and electricity generator. From that time, they became selfish and always argued with other at night. The place became not quiet. Lastly, the mountain could not stand for the heat of electricity generator and explore. Then, the people returned to the existence and lived happily. <br /><br /><br /><table><tr><td><img src=""http://www.archive.org/images/icdllogo.jpg"" alt=""icdllogo.jpg"" /></td> <td>This book will be available shortly on the <a href=""http://www.icdlbooks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">International Children's Digital Library</a>, a joint project of the Internet Archive and University Of Maryland. </td> </tr></table>","","hooevil","","Shell Evil"

Very soon, a carnival ofthe nation would be held. The prince and princess were responsible for sweeping and performing. They swept every place and sent the loving bubbles to each citizen and made everybody happy. Story 2: In a colorful world, black was not very welcome. So Black decided to leave and collect back all the black colors from the world. Afterwards, the other colors and people of the world discovered that this world could not survive without black. They met with black again and apologized to him. Then, everybody accepted each other and got along well with the delectation. Story 3: The uncle of the wolf behaved selfishly and always bullied other small animals. He only attended to his life and ignored other animals. Once he was in danger and was rescued by other animals. He felt shame and decided to change himself.
