Greetings!

genCollectionInterface (gCI) is a set of templates and HTML generation tools written in Python which produce a web browser-based interface to a book collection. These tools were created during the summer and fall of 2009 as part of the Rural Design Collective's Summer Mentoring Program.

Documentation for this project lives at:

http://www.ruraldesigncollective.org/lab/docs/

Please note that this download includes the interface files and not the books themselves. The books must be downloaded using the dl.py utility.

Thank you!
