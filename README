Greetings!

genCollectionInterface (gCI) is a set of templates and HTML generation tools written in Python which produce a web browser-based interface to a book collection. These tools were created during the summer and fall of 2009 as part of the Rural Design Collective's Summer Mentoring Program.

Documentation for this project lives at:
